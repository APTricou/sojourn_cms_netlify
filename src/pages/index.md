        Therapeutic Horseback Riding is the use of horses in equine-assisted
        activities. Horseback riding

        provides many benefits. The movement of the horse activates a variety of
        sensory imputs including:

        vestibular, proprioceptive, tactile, visual, auditory, and olfactory!
        Horseback riding helps with balance,

        strength, postural control, speech/communication and cognition. The
        Therapeutic Horseback Riding

        program is supervised by an Illinois State Board Learning Behavior
        Specialist and PATH Certified

        Therapeutic Riding Instructor.
