We, at Sojourn use equine assisted activities to proactively contribute to an individual's cognitive, physical, emotional, and social well being. Therapeutic riding benefits individuals in the areas of therapy, education, sport, and leisure. The experiences we have seen at Sojourn has enriched not only our clients lives, but our own.

Special Education and Reading Specialist teacher with a passion for horses. Barbara started Sojourn in 2009 with two horses, the one pictured above, Scootch, and Blackie, a retired Medieval Times show horse. Since then the fleet has grown to 10 horses, has moved into a brand new facility, and has grown into a wonderful community of people helping people.

Sojourn has plenty of work to go around, and would not be thriving as it is today if not for the volunteers who help with lessons, care for and prep horses, and keep the place running. If you are interested in helping by donating your time, check out our [Volunteer page](/volunteers).
