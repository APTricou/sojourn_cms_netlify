        Therapeutic riding is the use of horses and equine assisted activities to achieve goals that enhance physical, emotional, cognitive, behavioral and education skills for people who have disabilities. Activities and learning goals are under saddle, or on the back of a horse. Therapeutic riding instruction is under the supervision of a certified riding instructor who holds degrees in Special Education. Instruction is differentiated and specific to the goals and objectives indicated in an Individual Riding Program, often supplemented through student's school IEPs.

        We also support a parent or guardian and child preschool prereading program designed to promote and support the five essential components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Instruction is delivered by Barbara Mulry, who has degrees in Special Education and Reading Specialist. Additionally, parents will recieve information with regard to how to continue enhancing a love of reading between instructional sessions. Sojourn's Miniature horse, Chance, loves coming into the classroom and reading with the children!

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
