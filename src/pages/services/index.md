        Therapeutic Horseback Riding is the use of horses in equine-assisted
        activities. Horseback riding provides many benefits. The movement of the
        horse activates a variety of sensory imputs including: vestibular,
        proprioceptive, tactile, visual, auditory, and olfactory! Horseback
        riding helps with balance, strength, postural control,
        speech/communication and cognition. The Therapeutic Horseback Riding
        program is supervised by an Illinois State Board Learning Behavior
        Specialist and PATH Certified Therapeutic Riding Instructor.

        Equine Assisted Learning/EAL promotes life skills through an
        experiential learning approach. This approach uses horses on the ground.
        The focus is on life skills that can be related to: academic
        achievement, social/emotional behavior (learning situational cues
        regarding expected and unexpected behaviors), personal growth,
        self-awareness, self-directed learning, self-assessment, and team
        building. The EAL program is supervised by an Illinois State Board
        Licensed Learning Behavior Specialist.

        Therapeutic Carriage Driving provides an alternative experience that may
        support individuals who are unable to ride due to weight, fatigue, fear
        of height, inability to sit astride a horse, allergies, asthma, and
        other issues. Additionally, carriage driving may provide its own, unique
        sensory experience. Participants focus on safety, horses, harnessing,
        and driving. Teamwork is an essential part of the entire driving
        experience. Therapeutic Driving is headed by PATH Certified Driving
        instructors.
