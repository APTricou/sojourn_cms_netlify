        Therapeutic riding is the use of horses and equine assisted activities
        to achieve goals that enhance physical, emotional, cognitive, behavioral
        and education skills for people who have disabilities. Activities and
        learning goals are under saddle, or on the back of a horse. Therapeutic
        riding instruction is under the supervision of a certified riding
        instructor who holds degrees in Special Education. Instruction is
        differentiated and specific to the goals and objectives indicated in an
        Individual Riding Program, often supplemented through student's school
        IEPs.

        We also support a parent or guardian and child preschool prereading
        program designed to promote and support the five essential components of
        reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and
        comprehension. Instruction is delivered by Barbara Mulry, who has
        degrees in Special Education and Reading Specialist. Additionally,
        parents will recieve information with regard to how to continue
        enhancing a love of reading between instructional sessions. Sojourn's
        Miniature horse, Chance, loves coming into the classroom and reading
        with the children!
