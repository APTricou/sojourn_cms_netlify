        Therapeutic riding is the use of horses and equine assisted activities
        to achieve goals that enhance physical, emotional, cognitive, behavioral
        and education skills for people who have disabilities. Activities and
        learning goals are under saddle, or on the back of a horse. Therapeutic
        riding instruction is under the supervision of a certified riding
        instructor who holds degrees in Special Education. Instruction is
        differentiated and specific to the goals and objectives indicated in an
        Individual Riding Program, often supplemented through student's school
        IEPs.

        Sojourn TRC offers reading instruction with the help of our eager fleet
        of horses. Reading is taught by a state of Illinois licensed Reading
        Specialist who is qualified to test and instruct students with varying
        challenges in reading from Pre-K through adult. There are several
        components of reading instruction that include: Phonemic Awareness,
        Phonics, Vocabulary, Fluency, and Text Comprehension, all of which
        involves Close Reading Strategies. Youngest students enjoy our Take a
        Chance on Reading with our miniature horse, Chance. Older students
        practice their strategies and read with their assigned horse.
        Additionally, older students participate in discussions concerning the
        author's purpose siting evidence from text. Reading is not always an
        enjoyable task for students who struggle. Our horses, we hope, will
        enhance students' desire to read.

        Equine Assisted Learning promotes life skills through an eperiential
        learning approach. Horses are encountered on the ground. The focus,
        whether with individuals, school groups, or other groups, is on life
        skills related to the following: academic achievement, social/emotional
        behavior, personal growth and self awareness, self-directed learning,
        self-assessment, and team building.
